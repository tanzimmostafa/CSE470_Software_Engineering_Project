# CSE470 Software Egineering Project
This is a project for my cse470: Software Engineering course. For this project I created a Library Management System website using php, html, css, mysql.

Students can login to their account, search for books and order their books. Librarians can login to their account and view all the information of the students, books, publishers, staff and any orders. Additionally, a librarian has the ability to add, modify and delete some of the data of students, books, staff and publishers from the database

To run this project you have to first download XAMPP.   
Then in the htdocs folder of XAMPP copy and paste the whole lmsProject folder.  
The lmsProject folder contains a subfolder named database where you can download the database sql file used for this project. (You will need this database to run the project.)     
Create a new database in phpMyAdmin and import the separatelmsdb.sql file in it.  
Finally to run the project, open the XAMPP control panel and start Apache and MySQL.   
Then, open the intro.php file in your browser.
