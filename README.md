# cse470_software_engineering_project
## This is a project for my cse470: Software Engineering course. For this project I created a Library Management System website using php,html,css,mysql.

To run this project you have to first download XAMPP. 
Then in the htdocs folder of XAMPP copy and paste the whole lmsProject folder.
The lmsProject folder contains a subfolder named database where you can download the database sql file used for this project. You will need this database to run the project.
Create a new database in phpMyAdmin and import the separatelmsdb.sql file in it.
Finally to run the project open the XAMPP control panel and start Apache and MySQL. 
Then, open the intro.php file in your browser. For example, copy paste the following thing in your browser: http://localhost/lmsProject/MVC_Structure/Controller/intro.php
